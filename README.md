Objective: The project develops a marketing prediction algorithm with a focus on explainability using machine learning models.

Techniques: It uses interpretable machine learning methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparency into model decisions.

Data: The project applies classification models to marketing campaign data, predicting customer responses.

Explainability: Emphasizes interpretable AI by using SHAP values to identify feature importance and explain individual predictions, making the modelâ€™s decision-making process more understandable to stakeholders.

Tools & Libraries: Python, scikit-learn, SHAP, pandas, matplotlib, etc.

Outcome: Improved trust and usability of the model by providing explanations alongside predictions, which is critical for ethical AI applications.
